<h2>Voice and Tone</h2>

<p>Voice is how we describe the attributes of the Firefox brand. We use human attributes to describe voice, so that we can relate to the voice 
like we would a person. Does the voice sound real? Does the voice sound like someone we know, or would like to know? When you get voice right, 
you are expressing the core values and characteristics of Firefox consistently and authentically.</p>

<p>If voice is what we say, tone is how we say it. Tone lends emotion to our voice. While voice should be consistent, tone can and should 
change with the situation. When you get tone right, you are acknowledging users’ likely emotions and responding appropriately.</p>

<h3>Using Voice</h3>

<p>The elements of the Firefox voice were developed by the brand team 
to serve our needs across channels and purposes. They are broad and 
aspirational. It is helpful to translate them for our specific needs 
in product copy; this makes them more concrete and actionable.</p>

<h3>Using Tone</h3>

<p>The Firefox attributes live on a tonal continuum from Most Rebellious to Most Reliable. The weight you give to each attribute will change depending on the situation, and will influence the overall tone of the experience.</p>

<p>In the product, where Firefox can most deliver on the promise of reliability, the attributes of quick and alert will in most cases have more share of voice than untamed. But there are places even in the product where the attributes of clever and untamed will stand out. Consider two different scenarios and how tone can shift:</p>

<div class="wrapper2">

  <div class="block1">
  <h3>Forgot Firefox Account password</h3>

  <div class="block2">
  This is a pivotal moment for users, because it represents a deeper commitment to the product. Our words can reward them and inspire them to find more uses for it. Here, the tone should reflect the attributes of Quick and Alert as always, but can bring a bit of Clever into the mix.</div>

</div>


<div class="wrapper2">

  <div class="block1">
  <h3>Create a new account</h3>
  <img src="images/copy-images/voice_and_tone/pie_chart_new_account.png"></div>

  <div class="block2">
  <div>This is a frustrating situation and one that demands more attention than users might normally devote to their browser. We should help the user move forward, not charm them with our wit. Here, our tone will reflect Alert and Quick Attributes.</div>

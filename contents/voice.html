<h4>Voice and Tone</h4>

<p>Voice is how we describe the attributes of the Firefox brand. We use 
human attributes to describe voice, so that we can relate to the voice 
like we would a person. Does the voice sound real? Does the voice sound 
like someone we know, or would like to know? When you get voice right, 
you are expressing the core values and characteristics of Firefox 
consistently and authentically.</p>

<p>If voice is what we say, tone is how we say it. Tone lends emotion 
to our voice. While voice should be consistent, tone can and should 
change with the situation. When you get tone right, you are acknowledging 
users’ likely emotions and responding appropriately.</p>

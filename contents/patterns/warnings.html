  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Warnings provide short and relevant information when users are about to do something that could be damaging or harmful, without restrict them to move forward with their action. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We can help the users with the content of the messages (text, icons, color) as well as the context (where on the screen and when in the user flow the messages appear).
  </p>
  <p>
    We distinguish between two different categories of warnings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generic warnings</li>
    <li>High visibility warnings</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Generic warnings</h2>
  <% include ../includes/patterns/warnings/generic-warnings.html %>
  <h2>High visibility warnings</h2>
  <% include ../includes/patterns/warnings/high-visibility-warnings.html %>

        <a href="../visuals/color.html#yellow">Yellow</a> is the dedicated color for warning states. Warning text should be highly legible, with noticeable contrast against its background color.
      </p>

  <h3>
    Copy Rules
  </h3>
  <p>A good warning message is immediately pertinent, actionable, not obvious, and infrequent.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make the users aware of a situation or possible issue, although the may not have to act on anything now.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make the users aware of information that might prevent an immediate issue as well as a future issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid terms like <strong>warning</strong> or <strong>caution</strong> in the copy. When used correctly, the warning icon is enough to communicate that users have to proceed with caution. 
    </li>
  </ul>

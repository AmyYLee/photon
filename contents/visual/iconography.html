  <h2>Icon Construction</h2>
  <div class="cf nr3 nl3">
    <div class="w-50-ns fl-ns ph3 mb3">
      <p>
        A good Firefox icon is simple but still representing the right metaphor. Use universal metaphors that everyone around the world can quickly identify. Aim for a design most people can interpret correctly and wonâ€™t find offensive. Do not focus on a secondary or obscure aspect of an element. Remember that too many details can make an icon appear sloppy or unreadable.

  <h3>Grid</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox icons live on a 16&times;16 pixel grid. Keep your shape weighted towards the middle area of the grid reserving the outer 1px margin for visual weighting and maintaining relative aspect ratios. Designing with the pixel grid on helps you ensure that the icons will not appear fuzzy in production.
  </p>

  <h3>Shape</h3>
  <p>
    Use positive and negative space to create the shape of your icon. When lines principally shape your icon use a 2px stroke for the foundation and a 1px line for extra details. Rounded end caps and rounded line joins keep the icon smooth and friendly.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you have two rounded corners running parallel, the outer corner has a larger radius, set on 3px, than the one on the inside, set on 1px.

  <h2>Export Your Icon</h2>
  <p>
    Before exporting your icons, be sure to expand all the shapes and strokes overlapping each other. Remember to remove unnecessary anchor points to keep the icon as simple as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Name the artboard with the icon name. The name should describe the action of the icon, and not the icon itself. For example, when using a star as a metaphor for bookmarking, use <em>bookmark</em>, and not <em>star</em> as the name. Add a hyphen (<code>-</code>) to underline variations in the icon.
  </p>
  <% include contents/includes/iconography/icon-naming.html %>
  <p>
    Finally, save your icon as SVG (and .png if you're working on mobile).

  <h2>Color</h2>
  <p>
    Adapt your icon color according to your background.

  <h3>State</h3>
  <p>
    To better guide the user's eye, treats icons differently to create a better visual hierarchy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Primary icons</strong> are the main, and more frequent, actions on the page. From the interaction standpoint, a primary icon doesn't change its color: it usually comes within a button.
  </p>
  <!-- Be sure the add a link to a btn or some elements as soon as we have it -->
  <p>
    <strong>Secondary icons</strong> are the subsdiary, and less frequent, actions on the page. For this reason, the secondary icon changes its presentation when the user interacts with it.

  <h2>Placement</h2>
  <p>
    Give icons space according the <a href="grid.html">the grid</a> to increase visibility and interactivity.
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Placement</th>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Color</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Toolbar</td>
        <td>16x16</td>
        <td>Light theme: Black with alpha channel. <br> On dark Theme: Full white</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Panel</td>
      <td>32x32</td>
      <td>Grey <br> Validation color</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>In content</td>
      <td>32x32</td>
      <td>One color</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h3>Toolbar</h3>
  <p>
    Make toolbar icons different, yet harmonious. Each icon should be easily distinguishable from the others, but at the same time, toolbar icons should harmonise as much as possible in their perspective, size, and visual weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the toolbar icons are 16px per 16px. They have 16px margin left and right, center-aligned.
  </p>
  <h3>Panel</h3>
  <p>
    Panel icons live in the top left of a panel. Their size is bigger than the icons that go on the chrome toolbar, therefore they can provide more detail.
  </p>

  <h3>In content</h3>
  <p>
    Preferences and administrator areas in Firefox usually include a dark sidebar navigation. Middle-align both icons and labels.

  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <p>
    All icons should have a text-based equivalent for screen readers. If your icon allows interactivity, give it a text label.

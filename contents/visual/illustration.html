Principles explained: we can add this part when we're going to have some details on how each of our principles is interpreted in illustrations.
-->

<section>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Illustrations are a visually and emotionally powerful tool. Therefore you should use them sparingly and carefully identify the right situations to use them. If an illustration is used only as a decorative element, it may loose its communicative power and distract people.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use illustration to <strong>encourage</strong> people that are frustrated, or lost. Especially when something has gone wrong. Don't use the illustration if the user is in danger.
  </p>

    <figcaption>
      In pages like error pages the illustration brings a smile on the user's face.

  <p>
    Use illustration to <strong>introduce</strong> and <strong>explain</strong> a product, or feature. This can be especially helpful for new, misused, or neglected features.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use illustration to help people <strong>understand</strong> content by <strong>exemplifying</strong> it. This is especially useful in text-heavy components like announcements.
  </p>

    <figcaption>
      In pages like <em>about:rights</em> the whimisical illustration encourages to read

  <p>
    Use illustration to <strong>congratulate</strong> or <strong>celebrate</strong> with people.
  </p>

  <h2>Appearance</h2>
  <p>
    Firefox illustrations are created for specific contexts and purposes. They should not be used in any other way without consolidating the <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/DesignSystem/issues/new" alt="Request a new illustration by filling an issue">Content Team</a> first.
  </p>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    Most Firefox illustrations are built for a background of Grey 10 <code>#f9f9fa</code>.
  </p>
  <!-- Dos/Donts here -->
  <h3>Transparency</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox illustrations are built to work without additional adjustments to their opacity.
  </p>
  <h3>Dimension</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox illustrations should not use more than 40% of the available space, and not less than 20%. They should not be stretched or distorted.
  </p>
  <h3>Customization</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox illustrations should not be altered in any way, nor should they be combined with any other graphics, without the consent of the  <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/DesignSystem/issues/new" alt="Request a new illustration by filling an issue">Content Team</a>.

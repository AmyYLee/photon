  <h2>Elements of Performance</h2>
  <p>
    The perception of performance is largely determined by four factors: <br/> <em>Duration</em>, <em>Responsiveness</em>, <em>Fluency</em> and <em>Tolerance</em>.
  </p>

  <h3>Duration</h3>
  <p>
    Duration is the actual duration that a process takes. This is the element that is often referred to as “performance” in technical discussions. Different magnitudes of duration require different treatments to achieve an optimal perceived performance.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Terminology</th>
      <th>Duration <br/><i>[Milliseconds]</i></th>
      <th>Response</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Instantaneous</th>
      <td>up to 100ms</td>
      <td>Acknowledge user input within this time frame. Ideally, a visible process towards the completion of the task begins within this time span. (e.g. ???)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Immediate</th>
      <td>500–1000ms</td>
      <td>Answers to simple requests must be completed within this time frame (e.g. opening a new window)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Continuous</th>
      <td>2000–5000ms</td>
      <td>Answers to complex questions must be completed within this time frame (e.g. loading a web page)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Captive</th>
      <td>7000–10000ms</td>
      <td>Users will begin switching tasks at this point. If a process takes longer than this, it should be segmented.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
  <p>
    Responsiveness is the user perceived time it takes the system to respond to user input.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: An empty dialog appearing immediately after a click and then taking a second to populate with content feels faster than the same dialog appearing with a second delay, but fully populated.

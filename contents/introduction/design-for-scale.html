  <h1>Design for scale</h1>
  <p>
    Those guidelines helps you in deciding where it is important for Firefox to express his own language. They are a starting point to where you apply the Firefox design principles and where we follow platform conventions.

  <h2>Reuse What’s There</h2>
  <p>
    When building something new, try to reuse what we already have built and documented in the Design System. This will make it feel familiar to Firefox existing users, and will be implemented quicker. Do not force it though. If it doesn’t fit, it doesn’t fit.

  <h2>Prioritize Higher Visibility Work</h2>
  <p>
    The higher the expected visibility on parts of your work, the more important it is to align to Firefox Design System. If very limited visibility is expected, full alignment is of lower priority. Use platform components until you have time to better align.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not consider tradeoffs in very high visibility areas and loop in other designers working on that product or feature across platforms.
  </p>

    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>
      Imagine you're prioritizing how to ship the first iteration of "Bookmarks Management on Mobile" feature. The first step is to tap the "Star" icon. The optional final steps are when the user edits the Name, Location and Keywords before they save their changes. For the first step of tapping the "Star" (which has high visibility), you'll want to align every aspect with the Photon Design System. But for the final steps (which are lower visibility), you can use a full-page system dialog in Android because it's easier it implement and still aligned with the Android platform.

  <h2>Balance Firefox Style and Platform Conventions</h2>
  <p>
    Do balance between adapting to much platform and too little. Especially stay clear of the Uncanny Valley.

  <h2>Use Firefox Style for Visuals and Platform for Interaction</h2>
  <p>
    Use our styles for visual appearance and tone, and use platform conventions for any pattern that is well established on a given platform. This will make the feature feel familiar to new users and still convey our style.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use Platform When Possible</h2>
  <p>
    Use platform whenever it is possible to do so without impacting our own style too much. Pay special attention to reusing platform when performance is a high priority.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Firefox offers users a great deal of control over things like privacy, security, and customization.  This means that the user experience can be highly personal and idiosyncratic. Our products need to support this, but we still want them to look, feel and sound like they come from the same place and share the same spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s why we’ve created these guidelines. Having a consistent appearance and voice builds credibility and trust for people who use Firefox. Having well-articulated values and well-documented standards also makes decisions easier for people who design for Firefox.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you are building an add-on, designing a new feature or writing support copy, we hope these guidelines help you use Firefox design principles and systems in your own work.

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>
    The goal we set for <strong>Firefox Design System</strong> is to create a modern and faster experience. Our designs should be unified platforms that drive greater efficiency through well-defined and reusable components.

  <h2>Principles</h2>
  <p>
    We established a few principles to guide us during the design process. These principles help us to define our visual languange.
  </p>
  <h3>Adaptable</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox should adapt itself to anyone: From new users (simple controls, help/encouragement in using features) to seasoned Mozillians (customization/control of the entire browser experience).
  </p>
  <h3>Approachable</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox is welcoming, open, and inclusive.
  </p>
  <h3>Aware</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox is vigilant on behalf of users, providing tools to keep them safe while helping them browse better. Firefox is also perceptive, and looks for signals from users before deciding how to act.
  </p>
  <h3>Quick</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox should look and feel fast! From task completion to icon animation, Firefox is the most responsive and modern browser.
  </p>
  <h3>Supportive</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox understands user needs and supports them with relevant experiences. The browser should be helpful in both proactive and passive ways.
  </p>
  <h3>Whimsical</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox is fun to use! Our browser delights the user in both expected and unexpected ways.

<section>
	<p>
	Photon is our approach to designing and building modern, intuitive, delightful experiences, and appears in Firefox starting with version 57. The Photon Design System houses guidelines, reusable UI components, templates, and other resources to help you create products for Firefox users. 
	</p>

	<p>
	We hope that this system will help make your work more efficient, and help make our products more consistent while still looking, feeling, and sounding uniquely Firefox. 
	</p>
	<p>
	You can help us improve the system and ensure it remains current and relevant.

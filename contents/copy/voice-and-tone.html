  <h2>Design Patterns</h2>

  <h3>&ldquo;More&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Learn more&rdquo;</h3>
  <p>
    Use <em>More</em> to indicate an expanding text area, use <em>Learn more</em> to indicate a link to another screen or webpage.
  </p>

  <h3>Buttons vs Links</h3>
  <p>
    Use hyperlinked system text to indicate links to another screen or page, use buttons only to indicate a user action that updates the current screen or transmits information to the application, e.g., Submit, Update Preferences.
  </p>

  <h3>Touch-screen Gestures</h3>
  <p>
    When designing for Android, use the preferred Android terms touch, swipe, drag, pinch in, pinch out. View more in the <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/gestures.html">Android Style Guide</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When designing for iOS, use the preferred Apple terms tap, swipe, drag, pinch. View more in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/InteractivityInput.html">Apple Style Guide</a>.

  <h2>Point of View</h2>
  <p>
    In general, use the second person (you) to address the user in Firefox products. Firefox is a user agent, and this point of view reinforces the message that “Firefox works for you.”

  <p>
    Avoid using the first person (my, I) in the interface, as it can create confusion about who is being addressed.

  <h1>Capitalization</h1>
  <p>
    We use different capitalization styles for different types of content to improve scannability, organize information, and guide users to key actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    When building new Firefox products, we also align capitalization practices with platform conventions to match user expectations.

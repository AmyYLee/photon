    <p>For title case, most words are capitalized, with some exceptions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Capitalize the first letter of nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and pronouns.
      </li> 
      <li>
        Capitalize the first and last words of the text element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Capitalize the second word in a hyphenated compound if it would normally be capitalized as a single word. For example, you would capitalize both words in “Quick-Search Options,” but you would only capitalize “Add” in “Add-on Choices.”</li>
      <li>
        Lowercase articles (“a,” “an,” “the”) or prepositions with fewer than five letters (“to,” “on,” “at,” “by,” “from”) unless they’re the first or last words of the text element.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    Illustrations are a visually and emotionally powerful tool. Therefore you should use them sparingly and carefully identify the right situations to use them. If an illustration is used only as a decorative element, it may loose its communicative power and distract people.
  </p>
  <h3>Error</h3>
  <p>
    Use illustration to <strong>encourage</strong> people that are frustrated, or lost. Especially when something has gone wrong. Do not use illustration when the user is in danger!
  </p>
  <h3>On-boarding</h3>
  <p>
    Use illustration to <strong>introduce</strong> and <strong>explain</strong> a product, or feature. This can be especially helpful for new, misused, or neglected features.
  </p>
  <h3>Announcement</h3>
  <p>
    Use illustration to help people <strong>understand</strong> content by <strong>exemplifying</strong> it. This is especially useful in text-heavy components like announcements.
  </p>
  <h3>Success</h3>
  <p>
    Use illustration to <strong>compliment</strong> people or <strong>celebrate</strong> with them.

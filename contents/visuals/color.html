  </p>

  <h4>Color Contrast Values</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fail</strong> – Your text doesn't have enough contrast with the background.
    <li>
      <strong>AA Large</strong> – Acceptable contrast for type sizes >= 18px.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AA</strong> – Acceptable contrast for text sizes below 18px.
    </li>
    <li>

  <h3>Color Blind</h3>
  <p>
    There are different types of color blindness. The most common form is red-green color blindness, followed by blue-yellow color blindness and total color blindness. Red-green color blindness affects up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females. Ensure that adjacent color shades are distinguishable for color blind people. Use a color blindness analyzer to confirm your choices.

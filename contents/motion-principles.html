  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>
    Quick, supportive, and whimsical are the three principles that guide the motion design language of Firefox products. Following these principles, we aim to achieve a cohesive, enjoyable, and consistent experience within the family of Firefox products.
  </p>
  <h3>Quick</h3>
  <p>
    Animations should be fast and nimble and never keep the user waiting longer than they need to. The aim is to prioritise user perceived performance over technical benchmarks.
  </p>
  <h3>Supportive</h3>
  <p>
    Motion should help ease the user through the experience. It should aid the flow of actions, giving clear guidance for user orientation: spatial or temporal.
  </p>
  <h3>Whimsical</h3>
  <p>
    Animations should have a playful and delightful personality when appropriate.

  <h2>Curve</h2>
  <p>
    A rigidly linear movement looks unnatural to the human eye. Accelerate and decelerate smoothly to help your animation feel more natural.
  </p>
  <h3>Animation Curve</h3>

  <h2>Durations</h2>
  <p>
    Animations should last from 150ms up to 250ms and have to feel quick and responsive. Shorter animations are also more easily compiled by machines, which helps to achieve this feeling.
